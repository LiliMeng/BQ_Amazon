### 1. Bias for Action

**"Bias for Action"** is one of Amazon's core leadership principles. It reflects the company's emphasis on taking initiative and making decisions quickly, even in the face of uncertainty. This principle is rooted in the belief that speed matters in business, and many decisions and actions are reversible and do not require extensive study. 

At Amazon, employees are encouraged to take calculated risks, be proactive, and not get bogged down by analysis paralysis. The idea is that it's better to take action and iterate quickly than to delay progress in the pursuit of perfect information.

#### 1. **Situation**: Describe the context within which you had to take action quickly.
   - "In a previous project, we were developing a machine learning model for a client who needed quick results to meet a tight deadline. However, we encountered an unexpected data issue that threatened to delay the project."

#### 2. **Task**: Explain your responsibility in that situation.
   - "As the lead machine learning scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure that we delivered the model on time while maintaining a high standard of accuracy."

#### 3. **Action**: Detail the specific actions you took to address the challenge.
   - "Recognizing the urgency, I quickly assembled the team, and we brainstormed alternative approaches. I decided to implement a quick fix to clean the data, knowing it might not be perfect but would allow us to continue developing the model while we refined the solution in parallel."

#### 4. **Result**: Share the outcome of your actions.
   - "As a result, we were able to deliver the model on time, and the client was pleased with the results. Additionally, our quick action allowed us to identify a new best practice for handling similar data issues in the future."

### Tips for Answering

1. **Focus on Speed and Decision-Making**: Highlight how you made a swift decision that moved the project forward, even if you didn’t have all the information you ideally wanted.

### Example Behavioral Question and Answer

**Question:** "Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision quickly without having all the data you wanted. How did you handle it, and what was the result?"

**Answer:**

*"In one of my projects as a machine learning applied scientist, we were working on a recommendation system for an e-commerce client. Midway through the project, we discovered that the dataset provided by the client was incomplete, and gathering more data would have delayed the project by weeks. Given the tight timeline, I made the decision to proceed by generating synthetic data to fill in the gaps. I led a small team to quickly create and validate this synthetic data to ensure it wouldn’t skew the model’s performance.*

*We then proceeded with model development, closely monitoring performance metrics to ensure that the synthetic data wasn’t introducing any significant bias. The model performed well, and we were able to meet the client’s deadline. The client was satisfied with the accuracy of the recommendations, and we documented this approach as a potential method for handling similar data issues in future projects."*

This approach demonstrates your ability to take quick, decisive action while balancing the risks and driving the project to a successful outcome.

### Amazon Leadership Principle: Ownership

**"Ownership"** is one of Amazon's core leadership principles, emphasizing the expectation that employees act on behalf of the company and think long-term. It means taking responsibility for the outcomes of your work, beyond just your own tasks or projects. Amazon expects its leaders to exhibit a sense of ownership, to be accountable for the performance and success of their teams, and to make decisions that benefit the company as a whole, even if those decisions require personal sacrifice or going beyond the scope of their job descriptions.

In the context of machine learning applied scientists, ownership could mean owning the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning model, from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring, and ensuring the model delivers business value.
